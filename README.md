# The Djangae Project Template

This is a barebones Django project template configured for use on App Engine using [Djangae](https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae)


## How to use this to create your project

To get started:

- Install any supported Django version (`$ pip install Django==1.11`)
- Run this command replacing `projectname` with your desired project name:

```
$ django-admin.py startproject  --template https://github.com/potatolondon/djangae-scaffold/zipball/master  --extension py,yaml,md  projectname
```
      
- Run `cd projectname && ./install_deps` to install dependencies into a 'sitepackages' folder which is added to the path. 
- Run `python manage.py check --deploy --settings=projectname.settings_live` to run all security checks. Replace `projectname` with your new app name.
- Run `python manage.py runserver`

Each time you run the `install_deps` script helper your sitepackages will be wiped out and reinstalled with pip. The SDK will only be downloaded the first time (as it's a large download).

## Deployment

Create a Google App Engine project. Edit `app.yaml` and change `application: djangae-scaffold` to `application: your-app-id`. Then, if you're in the `djangae-scaffold` directory, run:

    $ appcfg.py update ./

If you have two-factor authentication enabled in your Google account, run:

    $ appcfg.py --oauth2 update ./

## Custom Domains

There is currently a [bug in App Engine](https://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=7427) which means that HSTS headers are stripped from responses served from a custom domain.  If you're using HTTPS on a custom domain then you should make a request to Google to get your domain whitelisted for HSTS.

## Troubleshooting

If you are on OS X and using Homebrew-ed Python, you might get the following error when running `./install_deps`:

    error: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both

[This is a known issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Homebrew-and-Python.md#note-on-pip-install---user) and a possible workaround is to make an "empty prefix" by default by adding a `~/.pydistutils.cfg` file with the following contents:

```bash
[install]
prefix=
```
